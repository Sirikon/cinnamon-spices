# Cinnamon Spices Website #

Repository for static content, implementing the new Cinnamon Spices
website design.

## Requirements ##

 - node
 - npm
 - gulp CLI (`npm install -g gulp`)

The project has no dependency on any editor, use the one you feel
comfortable with.

## Setup Dev Environment ##

After making a clone of this repository, run on command line:
```bash
npm install
```
This will download the required dependencies

To start working just run this on terminal:
```bash
gulp
```
This will start watching the source files, applying transformations
when they change and initialize a web server on `localhost:8080`.

Then start working on `src` folder, all resulting files will be in `dist`
folder.

__DON'T__ edit manually the `dist` folder, it's fully auto-generated and
any manual change will be lost.

## Releasing ##

There's already a gulp task for this, just run:
```bash
gulp release
```
